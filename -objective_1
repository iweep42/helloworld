HEADING 1: preconcieve notion


According to the Cambridge Dictionary, 

  It's actually nothing, there is no definition.
  
This wasn't what I had imagined, I was thinking of an idology that tries to think about other people's perspective and making them realise that they wasn't clearly communicating with them.

I will examine these words seperately,

  preconcieved is,
 
  " An idea,opinion having formed too early,especially without any train of thought. "

  notion is,

  "a belief, or an idea"

  OK then, in search of my thought, I had only came across these words,( The reason why I am searching for not just the meanings but also the words is that, categorising words makes the learning process much easier.)

    * empathy,

    * perspective-taking,

    * constructive feedback,

I am not going to focus on these 1 and 2, but the third one. 

  I guess, the constructive feedback is what I was looking for.
