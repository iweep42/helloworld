#time efficiency

  I will follow the guide of habit 3  in the book called "7 daily habits of highly effective people"

  Putting important things as the first objective.

  Planning your time according to stress relief plan will make the most of the day by saving time.

  ---------
    1. Necessity
                      Important + Urgent
    2. Effectiveness
                      Important + Not Urgent
    3. Distraction 
                      Not Important + Urgent
    4. Waste
                      Not Important + Not Urgent

    “Putting first things first means organizing and executing around your most important priorities.
It is living and being driven by the principles you value most, not by the agendas and forces surrounding you.”

  -Stephen R. Covey
