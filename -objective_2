  In here, I will focus on what's missing in my English. Simply by looking at what I am missing in the core. I will also follow a guide of a literature book.

But first of all, sentence constructions

    There are 4 types of sentences of core sentence constructions in the English,

  ** 1. Declarative Sentence
      - statement, information

  ** 2. Interogative Sentence
      - question
  ** 3. Imperative Sentence
      - command, request, suggestion
  ** 4. Exclamatory Sentence
      - emotion

vocabulary,
grammar,
punctuation,
idiom and expression,

Besides this, I think the rest are,
Reading, annotating, using. 

A practice of  essay writing will come tomorrow.
