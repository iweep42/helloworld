Project&lt;:miserable life part 1.

 Hello, I am writing this regarding the daily life that I have, which is miserable in my perspective. 

 My objective here is to esentially change that. Currently, I know that I am not much of a knowledgable or dedicated person towards my work but I am here to change that.

   3 main goals that I want to progress on 

       ** preconceived notion **

       ** English **

       ** Problem Solving Skills **

       ** Time efficiency **
